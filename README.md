# Multiplayer-Tic-Tac-Toe-game-using-Socket-Programming
The goal of this project is to use network programming to reproduce one of the most popular and ubiquitous games of all time, Tic Tac Toe, in an online manner and make it a pleasurable experience. Tic-tac-toe necessitates a thorough examination to discover even the most basic combinatory facts, the most fascinating of which are the number of possible games and positions. We implemented this project using the TCP protocol, which is more reliable than UDP and ensures the delivery of data packets between server and client. We also used signals to communicate the winner from server to client and to kill the process after the game was finished without manually terminating it.
